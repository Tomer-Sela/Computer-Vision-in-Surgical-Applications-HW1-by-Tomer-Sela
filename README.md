## Genral Information
Submission GitHub for HW1. The final report is add under [HW1_Tomer_sela.pdf](HW1_Tomer_sela.pdf)

The weights of the final model are called TS_CV.pt, older models of the training stages can be found in the "models" dir  .

## Building Instructions
Install the conda Python env using the requirements.txt.  
I recommend installing the environment using Conda and running it through Jupyter Notebook.  

## Running the Project
The best way to run the Project is via Jupyter Notebook. After launching the conda environment, using a console or cmd, you can run "Jupyter Lab" command in order to open a Jupyter interface over Chrome.  
The project contains 4 auxiliary notebooks numbered by order of operation and 2 Python files for image and video prediction, as required by the project instructions.
